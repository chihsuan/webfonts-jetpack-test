# Web Fonts API tester plugin using Jetpack's Google Fonts composer package

This is a tester plugin for the Web Fonts API. It uses the [Jetpack Google Fonts Provider composer package](https://packagist.org/packages/automattic/jetpack-google-fonts-provider).

## Modified by @ironprogrammer

In this fork, fonts that are already registered in TT3 have been removed. This change is to prevent re-registration of those fonts, an issue that should be addressed separately.
